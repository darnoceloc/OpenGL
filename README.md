# OpenGL Algorithm Visualizations
Project used for visualizing various algorithms and data structures. Was also used to learn OpenGL.

Controls:
- w,a,s,d for moving forward, the the left, backward, and to the right respectively.
- Left shift to go down and space to go up.
- Use the mouse to look around.
- Enter to pause and unpause animation. Program starts as paused.
- '-' and '=' keys used to lower and raise speed of animation.
- While not sorting, press r to randomize data. Won't work while sorting, not even when paused.
